However, there are areas for improvement to potentially achieve even faster convergence and better numerical stability.\n\nThe current approach uses a dynamic threshold `dynamic_mu` that starts larger and decreases to `mu`, which is good for early aggressive updates. However, the update factors are computed using square roots and then clipped, which might be too conservative. Also, the way `t` is used to scale the aggressiveness might not be optimal.\n\nLet's focus on:\n1. Making early updates more aggressive to reach a good rho faster\n2. Ensuring later updates are very stable to avoid oscillations\n3. Using a more direct approach to compute update factors\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Early iterations: more aggressive, later: more conservative\n    # Use a dynamic threshold that tightens over time\n    # mu is scaled by (1 + t) to be more permissive early, stricter later\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0 * t)  # Starts larger, decreases to mu\n    \n    # Compute the ratio of residuals\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # If ratio is too large, increase rho; if too small, decrease rho\n    # But we want to avoid oscillating, so update smoothly\n    # Target ratio is 1.0\n    if ratio > dynamic_mu:\n        # Increase rho to reduce primal residual\n        # Update factor based on sqrt(ratio) but bounded\n        fac = np.sqrt(ratio)\n        # Clip factor to prevent extreme updates\n        fac = min(fac, 1.5)\n        # Make updates more aggressive early on\n        fac = 1.0 + (fac - 1.0) * (1.0 - 0.5 * t)\n        new_rho = rho * fac\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > dynamic_mu:\n        # Decrease rho to reduce dual residual\n        fac = np.sqrt(1.0 / ratio)\n        fac = min(fac, 1.5)\n        fac = 1.0 + (fac - 1.0) * (1.0 - 0.5 * t)\n        new_rho = rho / fac\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Ensure rho doesn't become too large or too small\n    # Clip to a reasonable range\n    rho_min = 1e-6\n    rho_max = 1e6\n    new_rho = max(rho_min, min(new_rho, rho_max))\n    \n    return new_rho, t, mode\n=======\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Early iterations: more aggressive, later: more conservative\n    # Use a dynamic threshold that tightens over time\n    # mu is scaled by (1 + t) to be more permissive early, stricter later\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0 * t)  # Starts larger, decreases to mu\n    \n    # Compute the ratio of residuals\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on iteration\n    # Early iterations: more aggressive updates (larger factor)\n    # Later iterations: smaller updates for stability\n    # Use t to control aggressiveness: t is large early, small later\n    # We want update factor to be between 1.2 and 2.0 early, and 1.05 and 1.2 later\n    base_factor = 1.2 + 0.8 * t  # Early: up to 2.0, later: approaches 1.2\n    \n    if ratio > dynamic_mu:\n        # Increase rho to reduce primal residual\n        # Use a factor that's proportional to the square root of the ratio, but bounded\n        # Make it more aggressive early on\n        raw_factor = np.sqrt(ratio)\n        # Scale by base_factor, but ensure it's not too extreme\n        fac = min(raw_factor, base_factor)\n        # Ensure minimum update\n        fac = max(fac, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho * fac\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > dynamic_mu:\n        # Decrease rho to reduce dual residual\n        raw_factor = np.sqrt(1.0 / ratio)\n        fac = min(raw_factor, base_factor)\n        fac = max(fac, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho / fac\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Ensure rho doesn't become too large or too small\n    # Clip to a reasonable range\n    rho_min = 1e-6\n    rho_max = 1e6\n    new_rho = max(rho_min, min(new_rho, rho_max))\n    \n    return new_rho, t, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the update strategy more straightforward:\n1. The `base_factor` now explicitly controls how aggressive updates are, starting at up to 2.0 early and approaching 1.2 later.\n2. The update factor is now at least 1.05, ensuring meaningful updates when needed.\n3. The raw factor is still based on the square root of the ratio, which is a good balance.\n4. We use `max(fac, 1.05)` to prevent updates that are too small to be effective.\n\nThis should help reach an optimal rho faster in early iterations while maintaining stability in later iterations, potentially reducing the number of iterations further.\n\nHowever, let's also consider another improvement: making the threshold more adaptive. Currently, `dynamic_mu` is always greater than `mu`, which might be too permissive. Let's adjust it to be more balanced:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0 * t)  # Starts larger, decreases to mu\n=======\n    # Make threshold more balanced: early iterations have higher threshold to allow exploration\n    # Later iterations have threshold closer to mu for precise balance\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 3.0 * t)  # More aggressive early permissiveness\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis makes early iterations even more permissive, allowing rho to adjust more freely when we're far from convergence. This can help find a good rho value faster.\n\nThese changes aim to:\n1. Allow more exploration in early iterations by having a higher threshold\n2. Make updates more effective by ensuring they are at least 5% changes\n3. Gradually reduce the aggressiveness of updates as iterations progress\n\nThis should lead to faster convergence while maintaining numerical stability."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
