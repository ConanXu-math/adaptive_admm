The current approach uses:\n1. An iteration-dependent mu threshold (effective_mu)\n2. Two ratios (r_ratio and s_ratio) for comparison\n3. A base factor that decreases with iteration count\n4. A diminishing component from tau(k)\n\nHowever, I think we can make the update strategy more sophisticated by:\n1. Using a smoother transition between early and late iterations\n2. Incorporating the magnitude of the imbalance to adjust the update factor\n3. Making sure updates are more aggressive when residuals are very imbalanced\n4. Adding a memory of previous updates to avoid oscillations\n\nBut note: we cannot add state beyond what's in the function. So let's focus on using the current residuals more effectively.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n1. Use the log ratio of residuals to determine the degree of imbalance\n2. Make the update factor proportional to the log ratio, but bounded\n3. Adjust mu dynamically based on iteration, but more smoothly\n4.

Uses a single ratio and its logarithm to measure imbalance, which is symmetric and more informative\n2. The effective_mu now has three stages for smoother transition\n3. The update factor is adjusted based on the magnitude of imbalance via a tanh function, which is bounded\n4. This allows more aggressive updates when residuals are very imbalanced, and smaller updates when they are close\n5. The auxiliary output is now the log ratio, which gives a better sense of the imbalance direction and magnitude\n\nThis should lead to faster convergence by making more appropriate updates, especially in early iterations where aggressive updates are beneficial, while maintaining stability in later iterations. The use of tanh ensures that the adjustment is bounded, preventing overly large updates that could cause oscillations."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
