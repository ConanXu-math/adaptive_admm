The top performers are simpler and use a piecewise approach with fixed thresholds and factors. The current program uses exponential decays and log ratios which might be causing instability or slower convergence.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The top performers use a simple ratio (r_norm/s_norm) and check against a fixed mu (3.0) with piecewise base factors based on iteration count.\n2. They use tau to slightly reduce the update factor over time, ensuring updates become smaller as iterations progress.\n3. They have a max_change per iteration to prevent large jumps, which helps with stability.\n4. The current program uses an adjusted mu that changes with iteration, which might be too aggressive or not aggressive enough at the wrong times.\n\nTo improve fitness, I'll simplify the approach to be more like the top performers while incorporating some good ideas from the current program.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Smoothly adjust mu based on iteration: start more aggressive, become conservative\n    # Use exponential decay: mu_adj = mu + (mu_start -

The key improvements are:\n1. Removed the complex exponential adjustment of mu, using a fixed mu=3.0 instead.\n2. Simplified the base factor to a piecewise function based on iteration count, which is more straightforward and effective.\n3. Added a max_change per iteration to prevent large jumps, which helps with numerical stability.\n4. Used the simple ratio for auxiliary information instead of log_ratio, which is consistent with the best performers.\n5. The update logic is now clearer and more aligned with proven successful approaches.\n\nThis should lead to faster convergence (fewer iterations) and better numerical stability, improving the fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
