The current approach uses a fixed `mu=3.0` for all iterations, but some other programs adjust `mu` based on iteration count to be more aggressive early on.\n2. The update factor is computed as `base_factor - t`, which might not be optimal because `t` is very small (diminishing step size). This could lead to factors that are almost constant.\n3. The auxiliary value is always `ratio`, which might not be the most informative.\n\nLet's try to incorporate ideas from other successful programs while keeping the code simple and effective:\n\n1.

The `np.log1p` is used for numerical stability when `ratio - mu` is small.\n\nHowever, this might be too aggressive. Let's try a more balanced approach that also uses the diminishing step size `tau` to make updates smaller in later iterations:\n\nActually, the current best program doesn't use `tau` in a significant way. Let's keep the original structure but add a small improvement: make the update factor depend on both iteration and the degree of imbalance.\n\nBut to keep the code length reasonable, let's try a simpler approach that was successful in other programs: adjust mu based on iteration. Since Program 2 and 3 scored 0.0826, and the current program scored 0.0829, perhaps we should not adjust mu. So let's stick with the original approach but improve the update factor.\n\nActually, the current program's update factor is `base_factor - t`, which is almost constant because `t` is very small. Let's make it more dynamic by using `t` to scale the update:\n\nWait, `t` decreases with iterations, so `base_factor - t` actually increases slightly, which is opposite to what we want. So let's fix that:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Compute the ratio of residuals, handling small values\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on iteration\n    # Early iterations: larger updates, later: smaller updates\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Adjust factor with diminishing component\n    # We want to reduce the factor as iterations increase\n    factor = base_factor - t\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05 to avoid too small updates\n    factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if ratio > mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = ratio\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\n    # Compute the ratio of residuals, handling small values\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on iteration\n    # Early iterations: larger updates, later: smaller updates\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to make updates smaller as iterations increase\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # The effective factor should decrease with iterations\n    # Start with base_factor and approach 1.0 as t increases\n    # But t is very small, so we use (base_factor - 1.0) * (1 - t) + 1.0\n    factor = (base_factor - 1.0) * (1.0 - t) + 1.0\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05\n    factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if ratio > mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = ratio\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis approach makes the update factor decrease from `base_factor` towards 1.0 as iterations increase (since `t` increases from 0 to 1, but actually `t` is very small, so it's a slow decrease). This is more intuitive than `base_factor - t`.\n\nThis should maintain the simplicity of the original program while making the update factor more appropriate for later iterations. Let's see if this improves performance."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
