Instead of a piecewise constant effective_mu, I use a smooth exponential decay from 2.0 to 3.0. This provides a more gradual transition between aggressive and conservative phases.\n2. The base factor now decays smoothly from 1.5 to 1.1 using an exponential function, which is more natural than stepwise changes.\n3. The update factor now depends on the degree of imbalance (ratio/mu_adj), making larger adjustments when residuals are more unbalanced.\n4. I use the log ratio as the auxiliary output because it's symmetric around zero (positive when primal is larger, negative when dual is larger).\n5. The update logic now uses the same condition for both primal and dual by using 1.0/ratio > mu_adj, which is equivalent to s_ratio > mu_adj but more consistent.\n\nThese changes should make the update strategy more responsive to the actual problem state while maintaining stability through smooth transitions and diminishing updates. This could lead to faster convergence by making more appropriate adjustments to rho, especially in early iterations where aggressive updates are beneficial but should be modulated by the degree of imbalance."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
