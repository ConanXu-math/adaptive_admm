I've simplified the approach by removing the dynamic mu adjustment and using a fixed mu=3.0, which is standard in ADMM.\n2. The update factor is now determined by a piecewise base factor that decreases with iterations (1.5 for k<5, 1.2 for k<20, 1.1 for later iterations).\n3. The factor is adjusted by subtracting t (which diminishes with iterations) and bounded below by 1.05 to prevent updates that are too small.\n4. The condition checks use the ratio directly, which is more straightforward.\n5. I've added numerical bounds for rho to prevent extreme values.\n6. The auxiliary value is set to the ratio for logging.\n\nThis approach is similar to the top-performing program (score 0.0826) but with some adjustments:\n- It uses a simpler condition without dynamic mu adjustment.\n- The factor is always at least 1.05, which ensures meaningful updates.\n- The piecewise base factor allows for aggressive updates early and conservative updates later.\n\nThis should help improve convergence by balancing the residuals effectively while maintaining numerical stability."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
