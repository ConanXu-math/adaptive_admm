The current approach uses a helper function `compute_adjustment_factor` and a dynamic threshold that tightens over iterations. However, there are a few potential issues:\n\n1. The adjustment factor computation might be too complex and not aggressive enough early on.\n2. The dynamic threshold `dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0 * np.exp(-k / 5.0))` starts at 3*3=9 for k=0, which is very large, making updates less frequent early on.\n3. The base factor in `compute_adjustment_factor` is 0.85, which is less than 1, potentially causing updates to be too small.\n\nThe best performing program (score 0.0826) uses a simpler approach with different base factors for different iteration ranges and adjusts mu early on.

Key improvements:\n\n1. Early iterations (k < 10) use a smaller mu (2.0) to update more frequently.\n2. Different base factors for different iteration ranges: aggressive early (1.5 for k<5), moderate (1.2 for k<20), and conservative later (1.1).\n3. Uses tau to make updates diminish over time, ensuring stability.\n4. Maintains numerical stability by bounding rho.\n5. Returns a meaningful auxiliary value (the larger ratio).\n\nThis approach should lead to faster convergence by being more responsive to imbalances early on while maintaining stability in later iterations."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
