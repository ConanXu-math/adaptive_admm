The top performers are simpler and use a more straightforward approach with base factors that depend on iteration ranges, and they use tau to adjust the factor. They also use a fixed mu threshold (3.0) without dynamic adjustment.\n\nThe current program uses a dynamic mu_adj that starts larger and decays, which might be causing less effective updates. Also, the update factor is computed using sqrt(ratio) which can be too aggressive or not aggressive enough. Let's simplify and adopt a strategy similar to the top performers.\n\nKey improvements:\n1. Use a fixed mu=3.0 for consistency with top performers.\n2. Use base factors that depend on iteration number to be aggressive early and conservative later.\n3. Use tau to adjust the factor, ensuring it decreases with iterations.\n4. Use both r_ratio and s_ratio for better balance (like in Program 1).\n5. Keep the code length under control (current code is 65 lines, which is fine).\n\nLet's implement a strategy that:\n- For early iterations (k < 5): base_factor = 1.5\n- For mid iterations (5 <= k < 20): base_factor = 1.2\n- For later iterations: base_factor = 1.1\n- Adjust factor with tau: factor = max(base_factor - t, 1.05)\n- Use both r_ratio and s_ratio with mu=3.0\n\nHere's the plan to replace the current update_rho function:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Dynamic threshold: start larger, decrease to mu\n    # Using exponential decay for smooth transition\n    mu_adj = mu * (1.0 + 2.0 * np.exp(-0.1 * k))\n    \n    # Compute ratio safely\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on ratio, but bounded\n    # More aggressive early, conservative later\n    if ratio > mu_adj:\n        # Increase rho\n        fac = np.sqrt(ratio)\n        fac = min(fac, 1.5)  # Bound the factor\n        # Scale aggressiveness with iteration\n        fac = 1.0 + (fac - 1.0) * (1.0 - 0.5 * t)\n        new_rho = rho * fac\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > mu_adj:\n        # Decrease rho\n        fac = np.sqrt(1.0 / ratio)\n        fac = min(fac, 1.5)\n        fac = 1.0 + (fac - 1.0) * (1.0 - 0.5 * t)\n        new_rho = rho / fac\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Clip rho to prevent extreme values\n    rho_min = 1e-6\n    rho_max = 1e6\n    new_rho = max(rho_min, min(new_rho, rho_max))\n    \n    return new_rho, t, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute both ratios for balanced decision\n    r_ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    s_ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine base factor based on iteration\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Adjust factor to decrease with iterations\n    factor = base_factor - t\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05 for meaningful updates\n    factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Check conditions using both ratios\n    if r_ratio > mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif s_ratio > mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Both residuals are balanced\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the larger ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = max(r_ratio, s_ratio)\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change simplifies the approach, making it more similar to the top performers while using both ratios for better balance. The use of both r_ratio and s_ratio is inspired by Program 1, which had a score of 0.0829. The base factors are chosen to be aggressive early and conservative later, which should help with faster convergence while maintaining stability.\n\nNote: The auxiliary value is set to the larger ratio, which provides useful information about the imbalance. Also, the factor is adjusted with tau to diminish over time, preventing oscillations in later iterations."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
