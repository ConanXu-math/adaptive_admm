However, the best-performing programs (score 0.0826) use a different strategy: they adjust mu and base factors based on iteration number, and use two separate ratios (r_ratio and s_ratio) rather than a single ratio. This seems to be more effective for faster convergence.\n\nThe current program has a fitness of 0.0767, which is lower than the top score of 0.0826. To improve, we should adopt elements from the top-performing programs while maintaining numerical stability.\n\nKey observations from top programs:\n1. They use separate ratios: r_ratio = r_norm/s_norm and s_ratio = s_norm/r_norm\n2. They adjust mu based on iteration (smaller mu early for more frequent updates)\n3. They use base factors that decrease with iterations (1.5 -> 1.2 -> 1.1)\n4. They ensure a minimum factor of 1.05\n5. They bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n\nHowever, the current program uses tau to dampen updates, which might be too conservative.
