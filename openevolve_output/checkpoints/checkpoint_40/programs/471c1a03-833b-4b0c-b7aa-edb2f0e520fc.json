The update strategy is to multiply or divide `rho` by `fac` when primal or dual residuals are imbalanced. However, this approach may not adapt well across iterations, leading to potential oscillations or slow convergence.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The factor `fac` is always greater than 0.85, which can be too conservative, especially in early iterations.\n2. The threshold `mu=3.0` is fixed, which may not be optimal for balancing residuals.\n3. The update doesn't consider the magnitude of the imbalance, only whether it exceeds a fixed multiple.\n\nTo improve convergence, we can:\n1. Make the update more aggressive in early iterations and more conservative later.\n2. Adjust the threshold based on iteration count to be stricter as we progress.\n3. Use a dynamic factor that depends on the residual ratio.\n\nLet's modify the function to:\n- Use a more aggressive update in early iterations by having a larger factor when `k` is small.\n- Adjust `mu` to be tighter as iterations increase to enforce better balance.\n- Use a factor that decreases over time to prevent oscillations.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    fac = 0.85 + t\n\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * fac, t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / fac, t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Adjust mu to be tighter as iterations increase\n    # Start with a larger threshold early, then reduce to enforce balance\n    mu_adj = mu * (1.0 + 2.0 * np.exp(-0.1 * k))\n    \n    # Dynamic factor: more aggressive early, conservative later\n    # Base factor between 1.1 and 1.5 when k=0, decreasing to around 1.05\n    base_factor = 1.5 - 0.4 * np.tanh(0.1 * k)\n    fac = base_factor + t\n    \n    # Check if residuals are imbalanced\n    if r_norm > mu_adj * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * fac, t, \"mul\"\n    \n    if s_norm > mu_adj * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / fac, t, \"div\"\n    \n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. `mu_adj` starts larger than `mu` to allow more imbalance in early iterations, which can help avoid premature updates when residuals are still large. As `k` increases, it approaches `mu` to enforce stricter balance.\n2. `base_factor` starts at 1.5 (when k=0, tanh(0)=0) and decreases to about 1.1 as k increases, making updates more aggressive early on and conservative later. This helps in faster initial adjustments and stability later.\n3. The factor `fac` is `base_factor + t`, which still includes the diminishing `t` for additional adjustment.\n\nThis approach should lead to faster convergence by allowing more aggressive updates when needed early, while maintaining stability in later iterations. The dynamic threshold helps adapt to the progress of the algorithm."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
