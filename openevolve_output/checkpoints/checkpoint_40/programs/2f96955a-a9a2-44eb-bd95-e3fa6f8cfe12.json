Simplified to use only one ratio (primal/dual) which is standard in ADMM literature.\n2. Made the update factor more aggressive early (base_factor up to 1.8) to speed up convergence.\n3. Used a dynamic `effective_mu` that starts larger (4.0) to allow more exploration early and tightens to the default mu later.\n4. The update adjustment now considers the square root of the ratio, which provides a smoother response to large imbalances without being too extreme.\n5. The factor diminishes with iterations via `tau`, ensuring stability in later iterations.\n6. Changed auxiliary value to log ratio, which is better scaled for logging.\n7. Maintained numerical safety with bounds and epsilon.\n\nThis approach should balance aggressive early updates for faster convergence with conservative later updates for stability, potentially improving the fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
