The current approach uses a single ratio `(r_norm + eps) / (s_norm + eps)` and updates based on whether it's greater than `mu` or less than `1/mu`. However, the top performers use two separate ratios (`r_ratio` and `s_ratio`) and have more sophisticated iteration-dependent adjustments.\n\nThe current program's fitness score is 0.0767, which is lower than the top score of 0.0826. The top programs achieve better convergence (12 iterations) with a more balanced approach. Let's analyze why:\n\n1. The current program uses `sqrt(ratio)` for adjustments, which might be too aggressive or not well-tuned.\n2. It doesn't adjust `mu` based on iteration number, which the top programs do to be more aggressive early on.\n3. It doesn't have iteration-dependent base factors for updates.\n4. The adjustment factor is bounded between 1.0 and 2.0, which might not be optimal.\n\nLet's modify the current program to incorporate elements from the top performers while keeping some of its structure for diversity. We'll:\n1. Use two separate ratios for better balance\n2. Add iteration-dependent `mu` and base factors\n3. Keep the `sqrt` adjustment but with better tuning\n4.

Uses two separate ratios (`r_ratio` and `s_ratio`) for better balance, similar to top performers.\n2. Adjusts `mu` based on iteration number to be more aggressive early on.\n3. Uses iteration-dependent base factors for updates.\n4. Combines the `sqrt` adjustment from the current program with the base factor approach from top performers.\n5. Ensures numerical stability by bounding `rho`.\n6. Returns the larger ratio as auxiliary information, which might be useful for logging.\n\nThis approach should balance the need for aggressive updates early on with stability later, potentially leading to faster convergence while maintaining numerical stability. The combination of base factors and sqrt adjustments might offer a good trade-off between responsiveness and smoothness."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
