The top-performing program (score 0.0826) uses a strategy that is more aggressive in early iterations with larger update factors and adjusts mu based on iteration count.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The current program uses a mu_adj that increases with iterations (2.0, 3.0, 4.0), making it more conservative over time. However, the best performer uses a smaller mu (2.0) for early iterations and then switches to the default mu (3.0).\n2. The update factor in the current program is computed in a way that might not be aggressive enough. The best performer uses base factors of 1.5, 1.2, and 1.1 for different iteration ranges, which are more substantial.\n3. The current program doesn't bound rho between reasonable limits, which could lead to numerical issues.\n\nLet's improve by:\n1.
