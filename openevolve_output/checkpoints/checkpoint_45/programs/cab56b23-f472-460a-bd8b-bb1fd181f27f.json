However, there might be room for improvement by making the update strategy more adaptive to the residual magnitudes and their balance.\n\nThe current program uses a fixed threshold `mu=3.0` and updates `rho` by a factor that depends on iteration count. However, the best performer (Program 1) uses a more sophisticated approach with dynamic thresholds and factors based on residual scales. But it's more complex and longer.\n\nSince the goal is to improve fitness (which likely corresponds to faster convergence or better final accuracy), I'll try to incorporate some of the best ideas while keeping the code concise.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Early iterations should be more aggressive to quickly balance residuals.\n2. Later iterations should be more stable to avoid oscillations.\n3. The update factor should consider how unbalanced the residuals are.\n\nLet's modify the current program to:\n1. Use a dynamic threshold that decreases in early iterations to encourage more updates.\n2. Make the update factor proportional to the degree of imbalance.\n3. Add bounds to prevent excessive changes per iteration.\n\nHere's the plan:\n- Adjust `mu` based on iteration: lower in early iterations to be more sensitive.\n- Compute the ratio of residuals and use a factor that scales with the ratio.\n- Use a maximum change per iteration to prevent instability.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Compute the ratio of residuals, handling small values\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on iteration\n    # Early iterations: larger updates, later: smaller updates\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Adjust factor with diminishing component\n    # We want to reduce the factor as iterations increase\n    factor = base_factor -

This makes updates larger when residuals are very unbalanced, which should help correct imbalances faster.\n4. **Maximum change per iteration**: Added a limit to prevent rho from changing by more than a factor of 10 in one iteration, which prevents instability.\n5. **Numerical stability**: Kept bounds on rho (1e-6 to 1e6).\n\nThis approach aims to balance aggressive early updates with later stability, and to make updates proportional to the degree of imbalance. This should help achieve faster convergence while maintaining numerical stability."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
