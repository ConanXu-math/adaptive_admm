Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program and the evolution history, I notice that the best score was 0.0826 (Program 1) which used a piecewise strategy with different base factors for early, mid, and late iterations. The current program has a score of 0.0764, which is lower. The current approach uses a dynamic threshold and base factor that changes with iteration, but it might be too complex and not aggressive enough early on.\n\nThe key insight from the top performer is to have distinct behaviors for different iteration ranges: early iterations (k < 5, k < 20) with larger update factors, and later iterations with smaller ones. Also, it uses both r_ratio and s_ratio separately, which might be more precise than just one ratio.\n\nLet's simplify the current approach and adopt a strategy similar to the best performer, but with some adjustments to improve numerical stability and convergence speed.\n\nGoals:\n1. Early iterations: aggressive updates to quickly find a good rho.\n2. Later iterations: conservative updates to avoid oscillations.\n3. Use both r_ratio and s_ratio to decide updates, which can be more balanced.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n- For early iterations (k < 5), use a larger base factor (1.5) and a smaller effective mu (2.0) to update more frequently.\n- For mid iterations (5 <= k < 20), use base factor 1.2 and effective mu 2.5.\n- For later iterations (k >= 20), use base factor 1.1 and effective mu 3.0.\n- Use tau to add a diminishing component, but ensure updates are not too small.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Early iterations: more aggressive, later: more conservative\n    # Use a dynamic threshold that tightens over time\n    # mu is scaled by (1 + t) to be more permissive early, stricter later\n    # Make threshold more balanced: early iterations have higher threshold to allow exploration\n    # Later iterations have threshold closer to mu for precise balance\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 3.0 * t)  # More aggressive early permissiveness\n    \n    # Compute the ratio of residuals\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on iteration\n    # Early iterations: more aggressive updates (larger factor)\n    # Later iterations: smaller updates for stability\n    # Use t to control aggressiveness: t is large early, small later\n    # We want update factor to be between 1.2 and 2.0 early, and 1.05 and 1.2 later\n    base_factor = 1.2 + 0.8 * t  # Early: up to 2.0, later: approaches 1.2\n    \n    if ratio > dynamic_mu:\n        # Increase rho to reduce primal residual\n        # Use a factor that's proportional to the square root of the ratio, but bounded\n        # Make it more aggressive early on\n        raw_factor = np.sqrt(ratio)\n        # Scale by base_factor, but ensure it's not too extreme\n        fac = min(raw_factor, base_factor)\n        # Ensure minimum update\n        fac = max(fac, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho * fac\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > dynamic_mu:\n        # Decrease rho to reduce dual residual\n        raw_factor = np.sqrt(1.0 / ratio)\n        fac = min(raw_factor, base_factor)\n        fac = max(fac, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho / fac\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Ensure rho doesn't become too large or too small\n    # Clip to a reasonable range\n    rho_min = 1e-6\n    rho_max = 1e6\n    new_rho = max(rho_min, min(new_rho, rho_max))\n    \n    return new_rho, t, mode\n=======\n    # Adjust mu based on iteration to be more aggressive early on\n    if k < 5:\n        effective_mu = 2.0\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        effective_mu = 2.5\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        effective_mu = mu  # 3.0\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Compute the ratio of residuals, handling small values\n    r_ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    s_ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # The adjustment factor should be between base_factor and 1/base_factor\n    # But we want to make sure updates are not too small\n    if r_ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        # Increase rho to penalize primal infeasibility more\n        # Use a factor that decreases with iterations\n        factor = base_factor - 0.5 * t\n        # Ensure factor is at least 1.05\n        factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif s_ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        # Decrease rho to penalize dual infeasibility more\n        factor = base_factor - 0.5 * t\n        factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Both residuals are balanced\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the larger ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = r_ratio if r_ratio > s_ratio else s_ratio\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. The new code uses a piecewise strategy for effective_mu and base_factor based on iteration ranges, which was successful in the top performer.\n2. We compute both r_ratio and s_ratio to separately check primal and dual residual imbalances, which is more precise than using a single ratio.\n3. The update factor is derived from base_factor with a diminishing component from tau, ensuring that updates become smaller over time.\n4. We ensure a minimum factor of 1.05 to avoid updates that are too small and slow down convergence.\n5. The auxiliary value is set to the larger ratio, which can be useful for logging.\n6. The rho is clipped to a safe range to maintain numerical stability.\n\nThis approach should lead to faster convergence by being more aggressive early on and more stable later, balancing primal and dual residuals effectively."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
