The top performers use a simpler approach with just one ratio (r_norm/s_norm) and check both conditions using the same mu, while the current program uses two ratios (r_ratio and s_ratio) and adjusts mu based on iteration.\n\nHowever, the top performers achieve better fitness with fewer lines of code. The current program may be overcomplicating things, which could lead to slower convergence. Let's simplify towards the approach used in Program 2, which is one of the top performers.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The top performers use a single ratio: r_norm/s_norm\n2. They check if ratio > mu or 1/ratio > mu\n3. They use a diminishing factor based on iteration and tau\n4. They have clear iteration-based thresholds for base_factor\n\nThe current program uses two separate ratios, which might be causing unnecessary complexity without benefit. Let's simplify to match the top performer's approach while keeping some of the good ideas from the current program.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Use a single ratio (r_norm/s_norm) like the top performers\n2. Keep the iteration-based adjustment of mu (but make it simpler)\n3. Keep the iteration-based base_factor\n4. Add bounds to prevent extreme changes per iteration (like in Inspiration 1)\n5. Make sure the code is concise (under 500 characters)\n\nLet's implement these changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Adjust mu based on iteration: be more aggressive early on\n    if k < 10:\n        effective_mu = 2.0\n    else:\n        effective_mu = mu\n    \n    # Compute the ratio of residuals, handling small values\n    r_ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    s_ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine update factor based on iteration\n    # Early iterations: larger updates, later: smaller updates\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # The adjustment factor should be between base_factor and 1/base_factor\n    # But we want to make sure updates are not too small\n    if r_ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        # Increase rho to penalize primal infeasibility more\n        # Use a factor that decreases with iterations\n        factor = base_factor - t\n        # Ensure factor is at least 1.05\n        factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif s_ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        # Decrease rho to penalize dual infeasibility more\n        factor = base_factor - t\n        factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Both residuals are balanced\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = r_ratio if r_ratio > s_ratio else s_ratio\n=======\n    # Compute the ratio of residuals\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Adjust mu based on iteration: more aggressive early (lower threshold)\n    if k < 10:\n        effective_mu = 2.0\n    else:\n        effective_mu = mu\n    \n    # Determine base update factor based on iteration\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Adjust factor to decrease with iterations\n    factor = base_factor - t\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05 for meaningful updates\n    factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Balanced residuals\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    # Also limit maximum change per iteration to prevent oscillations\n    max_change = 10.0\n    if new_rho > rho * max_change:\n        new_rho = rho * max_change\n    elif new_rho < rho / max_change:\n        new_rho = rho / max_change\n    \n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = ratio\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change simplifies the logic by using a single ratio, which matches the approach of the top performers. It also adds a max_change limit to prevent large jumps that could cause oscillations, which was present in the best performer (Inspiration 1). The effective_mu adjustment is kept to be more aggressive early on.\n\nThe code is now more similar to Program 2 and Program 3, which achieved a score of 0.0829. By adding the max_change limit, we might improve stability and convergence. The auxiliary value is now just the ratio, which is simpler.\n\nThis should help improve the fitness score by making the algorithm more stable and efficient, potentially reducing the number of iterations needed for convergence."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
