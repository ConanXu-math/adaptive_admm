The current program is similar to some of the top performers but with slightly different parameters. The top performers all achieved a score of 0.0829 with 12 iterations, while the current program may be taking more iterations or not converging as effectively.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The current program uses a fixed threshold adjustment (effective_mu = 2.5 for k < 10) and base factors (1.6, 1.3, 1.1) which may be too aggressive or not optimal.\n2. The top performers often use a more dynamic approach, adjusting the threshold based on residual magnitudes and using both r_ratio and s_ratio separately.\n3. Some top performers also include a max_change limit to prevent large jumps, which can help stability.\n\nLet's aim to improve convergence by:\n1. Using a more balanced approach that considers both primal and dual residuals separately (like in Program 1 and D1).\n2. Adjusting the update factor more carefully based on the magnitude of imbalance.\n3. Adding a max_change limit to prevent oscillations.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Compute ratio of primal to dual residual\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Adjust mu threshold based on iteration: more aggressive early\n    if k < 10:\n        effective_mu = 2.5\n    else:\n        effective_mu = mu\n    \n    # Determine base update factor based on iteration\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.6\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.3\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Compute adjustment factor\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05 to avoid tiny updates\n    adj_factor = base_factor - t\n    adj_factor = max(adj_factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Decide update\n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Primal residual too large: increase rho\n        new_rho = rho * adj_factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Dual residual too large: decrease rho\n        new_rho = rho / adj_factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Clip rho to reasonable bounds for numerical stability\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use ratio as auxiliary value\n    aux = ratio\n=======\n    # Compute both ratios for balanced decision\n    r_ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    s_ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Determine base factor based on iteration\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.5\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    # Adjust factor to decrease with iterations\n    factor = base_factor - t\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05 for meaningful updates\n    factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Check conditions using both ratios with standard mu\n    if r_ratio > mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual residual\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif s_ratio > mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal residual\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Both residuals are balanced\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # For numerical stability, bound rho between 1e-6 and 1e6\n    # Also, prevent very large jumps by limiting the change per iteration\n    max_change = 10.0\n    if new_rho > rho * max_change:\n        new_rho = rho * max_change\n    elif new_rho < rho / max_change:\n        new_rho = rho / max_change\n    \n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use the larger ratio as auxiliary information\n    aux = max(r_ratio, s_ratio)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. I switched to using both r_ratio and s_ratio separately, which is more precise than using a single ratio and its reciprocal. This avoids numerical issues when one residual is very small.\n2. I reverted to the base factors (1.5, 1.2, 1.1) that were used in the top performers, which seem to work well.\n3. I kept the standard mu=3.0 threshold without dynamic adjustment, as the top performers (Program 2,3) did that and achieved good results.\n4. I added a max_change limit to prevent the penalty parameter from changing too drastically in one iteration, which can cause oscillations.\n5. The auxiliary value is now the maximum of both ratios, which gives a better indication of the imbalance.\n\nThis approach is similar to Program D1, which was a diverse program with good performance. By simplifying the logic and focusing on what worked in the top performers, we aim to improve convergence back to 12 iterations and a higher fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
