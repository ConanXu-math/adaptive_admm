The fitness score dropped from 0.0767 to 0.0430, which suggests recent changes made it worse. The current approach uses a fixed factor (0.85 + t) which is always less than 1 (since t is small), so updates are always decreasing rho when primal residual is large? Wait, if fac = 0.85 + t, and t is positive but small, fac is around 0.85 to 0.86, which is less than 1. So when r_norm > mu*s_norm, we multiply rho by a number less than 1, which decreases rho. That seems wrong: if primal residual is too large, we should increase rho to penalize primal infeasibility more. So the current logic is reversed.\n\nLooking at the code:\nif r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n    return rho * fac, t, \"mul\"\nSince fac < 1, this decreases rho when primal residual is large, which is incorrect. Similarly, when dual residual is large, we divide by fac (which is <1), which increases rho? Let's see: rho / (0.85) > rho, so that's correct.\n\nBut the first condition should increase rho, not decrease it. So we need to fix this.\n\nAlso, the update factor should be greater than 1 when increasing rho and less than 1 when decreasing rho. Let's look at the best performing program (Program 1) which had a score of 0.0826. It uses:\nif r_ratio > effective_mu:\n    factor = base_factor - t\n    factor = max(factor, 1.05)\n    new_rho = rho * factor\nSo factor > 1.\n\nSo let's design a better approach that:\n1. Correctly increases rho when primal residual is too large\n2. Decreases rho when dual residual is too large\n3. Uses adaptive thresholds and factors based on iteration\n4. Maintains numerical stability\n\nLet's create a strategy that:\n- Early iterations: more aggressive updates with larger factors\n- Later iterations: more conservative updates\n- Use a dynamic threshold that tightens over time\n- Ensure factors are always appropriate (>=1 for increase, <=1 for decrease? Actually, for decrease we want to divide by a factor >1)\n\nHere's a plan:\n1. Compute ratio = r_norm / (s_norm + eps)\n2. If ratio > mu: increase rho by factor >1\n3. If ratio < 1/mu: decrease rho by dividing by factor >1\n4. Otherwise keep rho\n\nFor the factor, we can make it depend on the ratio and iteration:\n   factor = 1 + (sqrt(ratio) - 1) * exp(-k/10)  for increase\nBut to keep it simple and effective, let's use a piecewise approach similar to Program 1.\n\nLet's implement:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    fac = 0.85 + t\n\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * fac, t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / fac, t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Inputs:\n        rho    : current penalty parameter\n        k      : iteration index\n        r_norm : ||primal residual||\n        s_norm : ||dual residual||\n    Outputs:\n        new_rho : updated rho\n        aux     : any auxiliary scalar (logged but not used)\n        mode    : string label (\"mul\", \"div\", \"keep\", etc.)\n\n    AlphaEvolve may change the internal logic,\n    but MUST respect the signature and return types.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute ratio of primal to dual residual\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Adjust mu threshold based on iteration: more aggressive early\n    if k < 10:\n        effective_mu = 2.5\n    else:\n        effective_mu = mu\n    \n    # Determine base update factor based on iteration\n    if k < 5:\n        base_factor = 1.6\n    elif k < 20:\n        base_factor = 1.3\n    else:\n        base_factor = 1.1\n    \n    # Use tau to add diminishing component\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Compute adjustment factor\n    # Ensure factor is at least 1.05 to avoid tiny updates\n    adj_factor = base_factor - t\n    adj_factor = max(adj_factor, 1.05)\n    \n    # Decide update\n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Primal residual too large: increase rho\n        new_rho = rho * adj_factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Dual residual too large: decrease rho\n        new_rho = rho / adj_factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Clip rho to reasonable bounds for numerical stability\n    new_rho = max(min(new_rho, 1e6), 1e-6)\n    \n    # Use ratio as auxiliary value\n    aux = ratio\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change:\n1. Corrects the update direction: when primal residual is large, we multiply by a factor >1 to increase rho.\n2. Uses a piecewise strategy for base_factor and effective_mu to be more aggressive early and conservative later.\n3. Ensures adj_factor is always >=1.05 to avoid updates that are too small.\n4. Adds clipping to prevent extreme values.\n5. Uses ratio as auxiliary value for logging.\n\nThis approach is similar to the best performing program (Program 1) but with adjusted parameters and without the extra r_ratio and s_ratio computations. It should converge faster by making appropriate updates and maintaining balance between primal and dual residuals.\n\nLet's also consider that we might want to handle cases where both residuals are very small, but that's already covered by the ratio condition.\n\nThis should improve the fitness score by making the rho updates more effective and correct."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
